# NST-Neural-Style-Transfer-using-Pytorch
This is an implementation of the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" (link : https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).The main objective is to have 2 images and form a new image with a content of one image but the style of the other.A naive interpretation can be the it basically applying a filter to a given content image.
